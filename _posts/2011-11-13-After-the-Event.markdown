A number of get together and hacker meetings took place after FOSSASIA.

### Debian Hack during Mekong Tour

We had a wonderful weekend in the Mekong with [Jonas Smedegaard](http://dr.jones.dk/), a [Debian](http://debian.org) Developer from Denmark. Jonas got met with a few local developers and  conducted a Debian session where he showed people how to set up debian  server and to develop an automatic SMS service on a cheap mobile device.

### Student Code Programs After FOSSASIA 2011

Another  big goal of us after the event was to "ignite" student study groups to  join existing open source projects or start coding on their own ideas.

Apart  from programs and meet ups with university students in the region after  FOSSASIA, the FOSSASIA team was hapy to support students and mentors  through the Google Summer of Code program. [Google Summer of Code](http://google-melange.com) offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. Since  2011 FOSSASIA is a mentor organization at Google Summer of Code.  FOSSASIA functions as an umbrella organization for a number of projects  in the region and supports new coding ideas of students independently  from a big Open Source project.
