FOSSASIA 2011 was held at [Van Lang University](http://www.vanlanguni.edu.vn/) in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam from November 11 to 12, 2011. The  event attracted 798 participants in 2 days including students,  developers, business professionals and government officials. The  majority of the attendees (2/3) were from universities, the remainder  from companies. &nbsp;Ninety percent of the participants were local (from  Vietnam) &nbsp;with the remainder from other countries. We had 36 volunteers  from [Ho Chi Minh University of Technology](http://www.hcmut.edu.vn/) (BKK), University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam [Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net) group and many individual contributors, who helped us in many ways  including registration, guidance, emcees, photography and video.


There  were a total of 24 speakers, 60% were local speakers and 40% of them  were from other countries, including USA, France, Denmark, Cambodia,  Germany, Singapore etc. There were 26 talks over the two days.

### Talks, Keynotes and Projects

The  first day of the event started with talks in the main hall. In his  keynote Dung Nguyen, the president of Van Lang University, gave an  introduction here to the current Open Source education across  universities in Vietnam and expressed his great interest on promoting  more Free and Open Source Software inside the University's technology  department.

It was exciting to learn about [UNESCO](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/) and the Free Software Community in the talk of Davide Storti - member UNESCO Open Suite Team. Our annual speaker [Chantra Be](https://twitter.com/chantra) from Cambodia again brought us a excellent insight to Open Technology  in Cambodia.Creative Mobile Technologies from Vietnam were presented by [Ian Morrison](http://gkxim.vn/about-us/),  the founder of GKIM Vietnam. Students had the chance to get a better  understanding how open source is used in everyday businesses.

Focusing on education in schools Nancie Severs introduced her beautiful work with the [One Laptop Per Child Project](http://olpc.vn) in north of Vietnam. Many Linux related talks dealt with questions about web installations and Content Management Systems like [Drupal](http://drupal.org). [Anh Tuan Truong](http://blog.iwayvietnam.com/tuanta/) (Vietnam)&nbsp; introduced new features in [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org) Linux after the release of version 15.

On  the second day students had the chance to learn in depth about Open  Source software projects in workshops and panels. One of the most  exciting get together happened at "Women in IT". The meet up attracted  around 50 young girls who showed great interest and passion about open  education and the global contribution of girls in Asia to FOSS projects.

## After the event

A number of get together and hacker meetings took place after FOSSASIA.

### Debian Hack during Mekong Tour

We had a wonderful weekend in the Mekong with [Jonas Smedegaard](http://dr.jones.dk/), a [Debian](http://debian.org) Developer from Denmark. Jonas got met with a few local developers and  conducted a Debian session where he showed people how to set up debian  server and to develop an automatic SMS service on a cheap mobile device.

### Student Code Programs After FOSSASIA 2011

Another  big goal of us after the event was to "ignite" student study groups to  join existing open source projects or start coding on their own ideas.

Apart  from programs and meet ups with university students in the region after  FOSSASIA, the FOSSASIA team was hapy to support students and mentors  through the Google Summer of Code program. [Google Summer of Code](http://google-melange.com) offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. Since  2011 FOSSASIA is a mentor organization at Google Summer of Code.  FOSSASIA functions as an umbrella organization for a number of projects  in the region and supports new coding ideas of students independently  from a big Open Source project.
