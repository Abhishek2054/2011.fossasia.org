**FOSSASIA 2011 Tracks**

Four sessions in parallel for   FOSSASIA 2011.

a) Mobile solutions

* Android, MeeGo, Chrome OS, Symbian, Bada, OpenWrt and embedded Debian
* Frameworks and SDK including Phonegap
* Lightning talks with app presentations

c) Web Technologies

* Frameworks
* CMS
* HTML5
* Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP

d) Operating Systems and Applications

* new interface design and lightweight trends with KDE, GNOME, LXDE and XFCE
* Package design and development

b) Women in IT

While   most Open Source and Free Software projects are based in Western   countries there is an increasing number of projects from Asia. Women are   also becoming a stronger force in the IT community. The FOSSASIA team   strongly encourages the participation of young women and achieved this   goal with an astounding participation of women in 2009 and 2010 – more   than half of all attendees were women. How can we make this trend   sustainable and support the flow of women into the technology companies?
